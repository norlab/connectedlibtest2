A thorough knowledge of your community is critical for connected learning:

<table>
<tr style="background-color:#E8B2AB"><th>Building Pathways Production-Centered</th><td>Community mapping can reveal assets to add to the network of resources you help teens connect to.</td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#F6DEB7"><th>Opportunity Interests</th><td>Community mapping can tell you what opportunities teens would like to have and help you find support for those opportunities and others. </td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#BBD0F8"><th>Shared Purpose Sponsorship</th><td>Engaging the entire community in the development of teens develops a sense of shared purpose and lets the teens know they are valued. </td></tr>
<tr style="background-color:#D8C5E1"><th>Relationships</th><td>Community mapping can help you identify groups of teens who aren’t being reached by the library. </td></tr>
</table>
