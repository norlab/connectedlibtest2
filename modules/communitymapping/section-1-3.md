What kind of data do you already have access to? Find out what community mapping-related work has been done at your library before. Start thinking with an asset-based approach by recording at least one community asset in each category (more if you can think of them!) that your library is currently connected to or working with in some way.

<table style="width:80%">
<tr height="20px")><th>Type of Asset</th><th>List of Assets</th><th>Connections</th></tr>
<tr height="150px"><th>Individuals</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr height="150px"><th>Associations</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr height="150px"><th>Institutions</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr height="150px"><th>Physical Resources</th><td></td><td></td></tr>
