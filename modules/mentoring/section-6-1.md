In working with emerging technology, youth librarians who are uncertain about their skills might want to partner with someone who can complement their background. 

INTK-001 offers this advice : “….it works better when you can have multiple mentors that can be there so when the students do get stuck, they have someone they can ask. And I'm very comfortable with a lot of this technology, but many of other programming staff aren't as comfortable as I am. “ (INTK-001) 

Braun and Vissner’s (2017) Ready to Code report outlines case studies of librarians who, even without formal technology backgrounds, have facilitated “computer science, coding, and computational thinking skills” programming and events. For example, librarians can provide teens with the resources they need to develop their own STEM focused programming such as computing and coding clubs.
