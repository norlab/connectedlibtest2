At times, a potential mentor may be intimidated or unsure about the "right" approach to working with teens. In these situations, a few approaches may help, such as: 

Be the facilitator in expert-led programming to help increase the mentor's level of comfort (Shannon L. interview, 2017) 

For interns or youth as mentors, allow them to practice and ask questions about how to lead and coach (Kitsap Regional Library, Make. Do. Share., 2017 beta). 

Provide support in the mentor's planning activities, workshops, or events. For example, allow the mentor to build the content or curriculum and then offer suggestions for making it work with a teen audience. For example, you could let them know when they should add breaks into the schedule(Shannon L. interview 4-7-17)
