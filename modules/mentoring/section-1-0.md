In supporting today’s young people, librarians around the country are providing a range of mentoring opportunities. Research evidence finds that quality mentoring experiences can make a powerful impact on the personal, professional, and academic lives of young people (Ito et al., 2013; Larson, et al, 2015; Rhodes, 2008). In this module, we offer practical ways and best practices for encouraging mentoring relationships (librarians as mentors, youth mentors, adult and community mentors) within a youth librarian context. 

### What is mentoring? 

Mentoring is a supportive learning relationship. 

Before someone becomes a mentor, they are often simply a friend. Most often, mentoring happens informally with little to no structure or oversight. Informal mentoring occurs when a young person has independently chosen a mentor because they trust them or seek out their expertise and advice (Meltzer, Muir, Craig 2016). Trusted mentors are characterized as reliable, honest, and open (Meltzer, Muir, Craig 2016). 

Some mentoring relationships might be established through organizations and include formal training and expectations. More formalized mentorship programs may require time commitment, learning objectives, and key activities. The experience might include regular meetings over a period of time. 

In other instances, mentoring can happen in “one-off” experiences where the mentor and mentee meet once or a few times. Regardless of the style and approach, successful mentoring experiences are usually mutually beneficial. Mentors may be motivated to develop leadership skills and to share their knowledge; mentees may benefit from the support, inspiration, and agency they receive (Rhodes, 2008).  

In talking with over 90 librarians and library staff who work with teens, we found that mentorship in libraries typically forms around such areas as: 

#### Careers and academic development 

Mentors offer advice on career paths or support the mentee in connecting their interests to academic success. For instance, INTS-65 described how their library’s mentor-led, DJ program, allows young people to  “...learn how to DJ and learn all the technology and software, but they can relay it back to school ...when they are using the microphone, making announcements, they enhance their public speaking skills.” 

To prepare them for the workforce, other libraries have offered mentorship to teens through STEM career development, internship programs, and leadership experience (Emery, 2016; Kitsap, 2015). 

#### Friends and role models 

Mentors and mentees interact socially, engage in fun activities, and provide each other with life lessons. In the learning labs at the <a href="https://www.chipublib.org/programs-and-partnerships/youmedia/" target="_blank">YOUmedia Chicago</a>, mentors foster a camaraderie with young people, creating a safe space for youth to trust them while working together on multimedia projects (Larson et al., 2013). While the library provides creative equipment like video cameras, art supplies, and design software, the mentors model how to use them (Hoffman, et al., 2016; Larson et al., 2013). 

#### Interest-driven and production-centered experiences 

These relationships offer someone to generate ideas with, engage in discussion, or participate in production-centered activities and shared passions. A mentor can help youth discover what they are interested in and facilitate them towards honing their skills. Mentors share their expertise and foster creativity through activities like robotics, sewing, podcasting, and open mic performances (Rhodes, 2008; Ito, et al., 2013; Larson, et al. 2013). For instance, youth librarians at the Providence Public Library connected youth’s interests in fashion with mentoring and guidance from design educators and visual merchandising experts (Hoffman et al., 2016; Shannon L. Interview on 4-7-17). 

### Mentoring and Connected Learning 

Where does mentoring fit within Connected Learning? Mentoring within libraries helps foster the following CL principles: 

- **Shared Purpose**. Through collaboration with people of all ages, mentoring encourages cross-generational and cross-cultural groups to work towards common goals (Hoffman et al., 2016). 
- P**eer supported**. By interacting with other youth through peer mentoring, learners give feedback to each other or simply “hang out” and “mess around” (Ito et al., 2010). 
- **Academically oriented**. Mentoring experiences and programs can be designed to support academic success, build career-related skills, or increase community or political engagement. 
- **Interest Driven**. Mentors support and guide youth to engage in their passions and interests, encouraging them to “geek out” (Ito et al., 2010). 

From the Connected Learning Alliance, check out this video [8:33 min.] from filmmaker Nic Askew. The interview subject is Brother Mike, YouMedia Coordinator and Lead Mentor for the Digital Youth Network. The films asks:  

Might we all have the opportunity to mentor another? 
How powerful is a single moment of validation to a young imagination? 
Might your influence travel further than you might imagine?
