Design thinking competencies synergize with such connected learning principles as **production-oriented**, **peer-supported**, **shared purpose**, and **multiple pathways**.  

For example, activities with youth that center on design thinking might include collaborative **brainstorming** (shared purpose/peer-supported), designing **prototypes** (production-oriented), or tinkering with technology (production-oriented). Using the connected learning framework, digital and networked technologies may be leveraged to explore design thinking by enabling young people to share their work process with a broad community (multiple pathways).
