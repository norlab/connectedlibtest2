  <li>Describe six major theories of youth development</li>
  <li>Apply concepts from the theories of youth development to the creation of connected learning programs and services for teens</li>

Youth development can be approached from many perspectives. In this section, you will be introduced to key theories of child development. In particular, we focus on: 

- Piaget’s cognitive development theory 
- Vygotsky’s sociocultural theory 
- Papert’s theory of constructionism 
- Bandura’s social cognitive learning theory 
- Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model of development 
- Erikson’s psychosocial theory of human development. 

You can draw on these theoretical perspectives to guide the design of your youth-centered programming and services.

  <p><span class="box-title">WHICH THEORY IS RIGHT? </span></p> 

<p>There is no single theory that accounts for every aspect of youth learning and development. The six theories described in the following sections have different strengths and weaknesses; many of them complement or build on each other. Each theory can teach us something different about to support youth development through library programming. </p>
