In this module, we have learned how major theories of youth development can be applied to library programs and services for teens. We have explored how teens form their own identity, how peer and family relationships impact them, and how they develop moral and ethical thinking. Turning our attention to teens’ interactions with technology, we learned how digital media affects teens’ development — both positively and negatively — and how libraries can respond supportively.
