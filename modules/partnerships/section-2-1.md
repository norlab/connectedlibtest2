There are many ways that community partnerships can benefit libraries. Partners can broaden the opportunities available to youth and can even increase the youth audience of the library by bringing the library and its services to youth who might not have experienced them otherwise.

A professional can share expertise and real-world insight beyond what even the most accomplished teen services librarian can provide. Partners can mentor youth or library staff, and can be resources for programming. <br>

Organizations with established audiences might include: scouts or 4-H clubs, YMCA/YWCA, schools, school clubs (e.g. the robotics club or Lego Mindstorm club), other youth-serving organizations, and city facilities like rec centers.<br>

<tr><th style="background-color:#8DC87C" width="30%">PARTNERS CAN BRING THE LIBRARY TO NEW AUDIENCES</tH><td>Youth services librarians need to get out of the library building and go to teens “where they are, rather than waiting for teens to to find a way to get to the physical library space.”[6] Partners might have spaces that youth are already using where you can bring programs. Look back at the list in the previous section—these same organizations might have spaces where you can take your programming.<br><a href="">CASE STUDY: CHARLOTTE MECKLENBURG LIBRARY AND THE MECKLENBURG COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE</a></td></tr>
<tr><th style="background-color:#BBD0F8" width="30%">A FULLER PERSPECTIVE ON THE COMMUNITY</tH><td>Even if library staff do a great and thorough job of getting to know the teens that come into the library, understanding the teens who don’t come into the library is a different story. Partners who work with different segments of the youth population can fill the library in on what they’re missing. <br>
