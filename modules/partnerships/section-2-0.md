</ul>

A **community partnership** is a formal relationship between a library and a local organization or individual who have joined forces on a project, program, or initiative that supports the goals of both entities. Unlike partnerships with national organizations, a community partnership is unique to the library and its local area. 

Partnerships are not formed by simple client and contractor relationships. Although a partnership may involve payment and contracts, it is a deeper collaboration. Partners work with the library to develop a unique offering.

**PARTNERSHIPS BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY, TOO**

The community also benefits when libraries join forces with other organizations. 

- The combined resources and knowledge of the library and its partners can provide services and programs with greater impact. 
- When different organizations work together, they can reduce duplication and focus more efficiently on serving a wider audience, providing more options, or addressing a greater variety of needs. 
- Working together can enhance outreach for each organization, letting more people know about what they offer.
