You probably have some idea of why you are conducting an evaluation—possibly one of the reasons listed in What is an evaluation? For instance, evaluations can directly affect future actions or decisions or change someone’s attitude or way of thinking.<sup>[9](#fn9)</sup> Evaluation questions transform a vague idea into specific elements that are tied to one or more outcomes and can be measured through assessments. 

All evaluations answer the same three fundamental questions, according to the <a href="http://www.informalscience.org/evaluation/pi-guide">Principal Investigator’s Guide:</a><sup>[10](#fn10)</sup>

1. What? (What happened or happens and what are the results?) 
2. So what? (Why did the results occur the way they did, and what are the implications?) 
3. Now what? (What actions, decisions, or recommendations can be made based on the results?)

  <tr><td>Formative evaluation</td><td>Periodic evaluations conducted during the development and implementation of a program. Used for course-correcting if necessary. Formative evaluation can look at how a project is progressing towards its goals whether the implementation of the project going according to plan.<sup>13</sup> </td><td>Are participants learning what we expected?<br><br>Are there any issues with implementation of the program?</td></tr> 

  <tr><td>Summative evaluation</td><td>Focuses on conditions at the end of the program and is an evaluation of the entire process. It may report results from earlier formative evaluations as well. </td><td>Did participants learn what and as much as we wanted?<br><br>What was the value of the partnership?</td></tr>
