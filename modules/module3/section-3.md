section: 3. Why Your Library Needs Connected Learning
title: Overview
subsection: three

Libraries are ideal environments for connected learning—learning in libraries is informal, flexible, and interest-driven, and it doesn’t (or shouldn’t) feel like school. Connected learning can help achieve your library’s mission and goals by promoting equity, by encouraging new skills and literacies, and building community.
