## Learning Outcomes For This Section

**After completing this section, you will be able to:**
<ul class="fancy">
	<li>Use your library’s Capacity Assessment</li>
  <li>Supplement your capacity with community partnerships</li>
  <li>Develop a roadmap for addressing capacity challenges in your library</li>
</ul>


Once you have an understanding of your library’s capacity in terms of strengths and weaknesses, as well as a comprehensive view of your community’s assets and needs, where do you go next? What do you do with this information? The next step of assessing your library’s capacity is to create a tool that will lead your future efforts. This tool will synthesize the capacity challenges of your library, and how these challenges can be addressed using strengths you or your community already possess.
