Connected learning and technology programs aren't just for library systems with a lot of resources--these programs can be done in every library with some careful planning. Each system and individual library have specific goals, needs, and capacities. You can imagine library capacity as a libraryâ€™s unique set of tools that you use to provide services. What tools do you have in your toolbox? This module will help you to understand the unique capacity of your library.
