# {{ page.section }} - {{ page.subtitle }}

In order to connect teen’s interests, relationships, and opportunity, connected learning programs follow a set of design principles: they are production centered, build pathways, sponsor youth interests, and create a sense of shared purpose. This section examines those principles. 

## Learning Outcomes For This Section
<ul class="fancy"><li>Name and describe the connected learning design principles: production, multiple pathways, shared purpose, and sponsorship.</li>
<li>Recognize implementations of each principle in youth programs</li>
<li>Evaluate your own programs to see how well they connect these spheres</li>
</ul>

While the three spheres describe learning contexts, the four design principles describe elements of connected learning experiences. Connected learning experiences are designed to involve:

- **Production**: Learning through creation
- **Multiple Pathways**: Providing teens with resources and pathways to success
- **Shared Purpose**: Connecting teens to an effort that is bigger than themselves
- **Sponsorship**: Peers and adults validating teens’ interests through mentorship and other support
